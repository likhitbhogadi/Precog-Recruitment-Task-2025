# PreCog-Recruitment-Task-2025

## s/Math + AI/ Reasoning in LLMs

## how to run the files

in the dataset_gen folder, there is a file named, datasetgen.py
run the file using the command
`python3 datasetgen.py`
this will generate the dataset in the /sample-data/puzzles/problems.json file

in the starter-code-data-gen folder,
there is a sub dir, called src
run prompt1.py, prompt2.py, and prompt3.py to make llms solve the problems and fill in the solution files
the solution files are in /sample-data/solutions

and running main.py will show how many of the problems the llm solved correctly

i have used the starter code given in the doc for this validation of the solution given by llm
i am using gemini 1.5 flash api for this

in the /dataset_gen/datasetgen.py file, i added code to generate a graph of the quesiton, a state diagram, i modelled the problem as an automata theory problem in which each string in the steps is a state and the transitions are the substitutons

the graph.py, graph2.py and graph_generator.py are for the same purpose, to generate the graph of the problem
graph2.py takes the problem in sed_puzzle_dataset.json and generates the graph of the problem

the various pictures in /dataset_gen are the graphs generated by the code, mostly via the older version of the code, the newer version of the code is more representative of the problems on the sed puzzle website
it has more reusable transitions which i saw as a pattern in the problems
i went from plain substring to empty string way of making transitions for the problem, to
modelling it as an automata theory problem of states and transitions
and then included dead states, cross transtions, etc to increase difficulty of the problem
i saw changing heuristics like
size of strings at various steps,
number of steps,
number of transitions,
number of states,
number of cross transitions,
number of dead states,
the sample space of random generations and different types of random generations changed the difficulty of the problem and
made it more or less representative of the problems on the sed puzzle website
i more or less came to the conclusion that the problems on the sed puzzle website cam mostly be modelled as automata theory problems and the heuristics i used in the code are modereately representative of the problems on the website
i was short of time to document, analyze and show different heuristics
and same is the case with prompting - task-2
i used the 3 prompting methods zero shot, few shot and chain of thought, although i was not able to do them rigourously to get good results, moslty i got a score of 0, i was short of time to improve the accuracy , the 3 methods are in the 3 files in /starter-code-data-gen/src

1. prompt1.py
2. prompt2.py
3. prompt3.py

i could not attempt task 3,4 on time.
metrics of evaluation,
bonus - man vs machine.
